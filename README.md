# Project 1 : Weather Application

- Allow users to input a location (city or coordinates) and fetch real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- Console-based UI with an optional Tkinter GUI.
- Optional SQLite/Pandas integration for storing weather history.
- Core features: error handling, user-friendly display, and logs.
- Deliverables: project files, executable script, and documentation.
- Future enhancements: weather alerts, multi-location support, and graphical weather trends.
